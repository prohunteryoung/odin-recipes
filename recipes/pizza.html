      Pizza Crust Let's start with the base, the crispy crust that holds it all
      together. With the crust, you can go a few ways: You can make homemade
      pizza with store-bought dough; use pre-baked crusts (such as Boboli) or
      even English muffins and pita bread for personal pizzas; or make your own
      pizza dough.

      Pizza Sauces Now for the sauce. There are loads of delicious pre-made
      marinara sauces for pizza sauce. We have oodles of homemade pizza sauce
      recipes, too. Beyond red pizza sauces, don't forget pesto sauces, white
      sauces, or even a simple olive oil and garlic sauce. They will expand your
      pizza potential by almost infinite proportions.

      Pizza Toppings There's almost no limit to the toppings you can pile on a
      pizza. Tomato sauce and pepperoni you know. But apples and walnuts? For
      sure. Fresh figs and prosciutto? Of course! Sweet corn and peas? Well, in
      Europe and Japan, corn and peas are common pizza toppings. Bottom line,
      pizza is open to an infinite amount of creativity where toppings are
      concerned.
